<P>Series 9 – Episode 9</P>
<P>The One With Rachel’s Phone Number</P>
<P>Written by: Mark Kunerth</P>
<P>Directed by: Ben Weiss</P>
<P align=center>Transcribed by: Andy Ellis</P>
<P>[Scene: Chandler’s Office, Tulsa]</P>
<P>Assistant: This kitty is Mittens, this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy 
in the cat condo is Jinkys.</P>
<P>Chandler: Yeah. That’s a lot of cats, Jolene. Single, are ya?</P>
<P>[Phone rings – Chandler answers]</P>
<P>Chandler: Chandler Bing.</P>
<P>Joey: [On phone] Hey. How come you’re answering your own phone? Where’s your 
crazy assistant?</P>
<P>[Chandler jumps up to turn the speaker phone off by lifting the receiver. The 
Assistant looks shocked, then storms off]</P>
<P>Chandler: What’s up, Joe?</P>
<P>[Joey’s apartment. Conversation switches between the two scenes when each 
person speaks]</P>
<P>Joey: Okay. What have we wanted to always do together?</P>
<P>Chandler: Braid each other’s hair then ride horseback on the beach?</P>
<P>Joey: No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are gonna be at 
the Wizards – Knicks game courtside!</P>
<P>Chandler: Courtside? Oh my god!!</P>
<P>Joey: Yeah, maybe Michael Jordan will dive for the ball and break my jaw with 
his knee!</P>
<P>Chandler: That is so cool. I’ll let Monica know.</P>
<P>[Monica’s apartment. Phone rings]</P>
<P>Monica: Hello?</P>
<P>[Chandler’s office, Tulsa – Conversation switches between the two scenes when 
the people are talking]</P>
<P>Chandler: Joey just called. He’s got courtside Knicks tickets for me and him 
tomorrow night.</P>
<P>Monica: Really? But tomorrow night’s the only one I get off from the 
restaurant. If you go to the game then we won’t have another night together for 
a week.</P>
<P>Chandler: But-t it’s courtside! The cheerleaders are gonna be right in … 
[mouths last words so Monica does not hear them]. That’s not the way to convince 
you.</P>
<P>Monica: Look. I don’t want to be one of those wives that says “You can’t go 
to the game”, “you have to spend time with me”, so, if you just realize it on 
your own?</P>
<P>Chandler: I…I…I know. You’re right. I wanna see you too. I’ve just got to 
figure out a way to tell Joey. He’s really looking forward to this.</P>
<P>Monica: [On phone] Tell him you haven’t seen your wife in a long time. [In 
apartment] Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really 
difficult. Tell him that…what little time that we have is precious.</P>
<P>Chandler: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’ll think of something.</P>
<P>[Monica hangs up, looking exasperated]</P>
<P>[Starting credits]</P>
<P>[Scene: Ross + Rachel’s apartment. Ross is tending to Emma. Rachel walks in 
from back. She comes over to tend to Emma]</P>
<P>Ross: Wow! You look…er…hm……I mean, it’s just the…er…that, that dress! Er…</P>
<P>Rachel: I hope the ends of these sentences are good!</P>
<P>[Ross laughs]</P>
<P>Ross: No, no…they’re good. It’s just been so long since I’ve seen you like 
this. You clean up good!</P>
<P>[Ross stares at Rachel]</P>
<P>Rachel: Ahh. [Looks down] Well, thank you! Ha-ha! [Ross continues to stare at 
Rachel] Okay – stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened 
[pointing towards Ross’s crotch] that happened [pointing at Emma]</P>
<P>Ross: Oh, right! [Looking away]</P>
<P>[Awkward silence]</P>
<P>Ross: So, are you. Ah! Are you excited about your…er…first night away from 
Emma?</P>
<P>Rachel: Yeah! Phoebe and I are gonna have so much fun! Thank you for watching 
the baby, by the way.</P>
<P>Ross: Oh, it’s fine. Actually, I…I invited Mike over</P>
<P>Rachel: Phoebe’s Mike?</P>
<P>Ross: Yeah.</P>
<P>Rachel: I didn’t know that you guys hung out.</P>
<P>Ross: We don’t. But, I thought that it would be nice to get to know him. You 
know? We have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.</P>
<P>Rachel: Awww. That’s so cute! Ross and Mike’s first date! [Beat] Is that 
going to be awkward? What are you guys gonna talk about?</P>
<P>Ross: Well, but, you know, we have a lot in common, you know, erm…he plays 
the piano, I played keyboards in college, or, he’s been divorced, I 
have…some…experience in that area</P>
<P>[Rachel nods her head in agreement. Door knocks]</P>
<P>Rachel: Yeah?</P>
<P>[Door opens, Phoebe and Mike enter]</P>
<P>Phoebe: Hi!</P>
<P>Ross, Rachel: Hi!</P>
<P>Phoebe: Ooh. You’re first night out, indeed!</P>
<P>Rachel: Okay, So now I think Emma is properly down for the night but if you 
need anything Ross…[pointing finger into his chest]</P>
<P>Ross: Rach, Rach, Rach: we’ll be fine. You go have fun.</P>
<P>Rachel: Okay. You too. And I hope you score.</P>
<P>[Rachel picks up her bag and Phoebe and her start to leave]</P>
<P>Rachel: Bye [to Mike]</P>
<P>Mike: Bye [Shuts door]</P>
<P>Ross: So, welcome!</P>
<P>Mike: I’ve got beer</P>
<P>Ross: I’ve got bottled breast milk.</P>
<P>[Beat]</P>
<P>Mike: Ahhh. Why don’t we start with the beer?</P>
<P>Ross: Okay</P>
<P>[Mike puts beer (6-pack of Fosters) on the table and takes his coat off. Ross 
and mike sit on the sofa]</P>
<P>Ross: So, Phoebe tells me you, er, play the piano?</P>
<P>Mike: Yeah?</P>
<P>Ross: You, you know? I used to play the keyboards in college.</P>
<P>Mike: Yah, do you have one here?</P>
<P>[Ross swigs his beer]</P>
<P>Ross: No</P>
<P>Mike: Okay [nervous laugh]</P>
<P>[‘Clink’ each other’s bottle of Foster’s together. Each take a swig]</P>
<P>Mike: Ahhh.</P>
<P>[Long, awkward silence]</P>
<P>Ross: Erm, you know, I’m divorced. Er, Phoebe said you’ve been divorced.</P>
<P>Mike: Yeah. [Beat] I’m sorry. I don’t really like to talk about it.<BR>Ross: 
[Lost for words] Yeah, er… that’s okay. We’ll talk about something else.</P>
<P>[They take another swig of beer]</P>
<P>Mike: So, you’re a palaeontologist, right?</P>
<P>Ross: Yeah.</P>
<P>Mike: My cousin’s a palaeontologist.</P>
<P>Ross: Ah!</P>
<P>[Silence]</P>
<P>Ross: Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.</P>
<P>[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s apartment. Monica has a bottle of red wine on 
the table, along with two filled glasses. Chandler bursts through the door 
quickly, pulling his suitcase along with him]</P>
<P>Monica: Hi! [Surprised]</P>
<P>Chandler: Hey!</P>
<P>Monica: Welcome home.</P>
<P>Chandler: Oh, well, look at you!</P>
<P>[Chandler closes and locks the door]</P>
<P>Monica: What do you think?</P>
<P>Chandler: Well, it’s great, well, I’m just wearing the same thing underneath! 
Look at you.</P>
<P>[Monica and Chandler hug and kiss. Loud bang outside]</P>
<P>Joey: Ooh. Hey, how come you door’s locked?</P>
<P>Monica: Just a second.</P>
<P><BR>Chandler: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Joey can’t know that I am 
here.</P>
<P>Monica: Why not?</P>
<P>Chandler: Because I didn’t know how to tell him that I couldn’t go to the 
Knicks game, so I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.</P>
<P>Monica: So you lied to him?</P>
<P>Chandler: Eh, it is always better to lie than to have the complicated 
discussion. [Monica glares at him] Except with you!</P>
<P>[Rattling of the doorknob]</P>
<P>Joey: Hey! Open the door! What’s going on?</P>
<P>[Knock. Monica opens the door slightly. Chandler sneaks behind it]</P>
<P>Monica: Hi!</P>
<P>Joey: Why are you dressed like that?</P>
<P>Monica: [Nervous giggle] Because I, erm, well, Chandler’s gonna be home in a 
couple of days, so I thought that I would just, er, practice the art of 
seduction.</P>
<P>Joey: I thought I heard a man’s voice before?</P>
<P>Monica: I was just doing Chandler’s side of the conversation, y’know like 
“Hi”, “How do I look” [In Chandler’s voice] “Really sexy”, “Could I be any more 
turned on?”</P>
<P>[Chandler slaps Monica on the shoulder. Monica slaps him back. It hurts 
Chandler]</P>
<P>Joey: Woah, woah, woah. Why are there two glasses of wine out?</P>
<P>Monica: Because, one of them is for you! [Monica goes to get a glass. 
Chandler looks at Joey through the peep-hole and Chandler ducks. Monica comes 
back to the door with the two glasses of red wine. Gives one to Joey. ‘Clinks’ 
the glasses together] Okay, bye, bye!</P>
<P>[Shuts door]</P>
<P>Chandler: You know, it’s funny. I’ve been practising the art of seduction as 
well! Hya! [Does a wiggle]</P>
<P>Monica: You might wanna keep practising.</P>
<P>Chandler: Yeah. [Chandler’s phone goes off] It’s Joey.</P>
<P>Monica: What?</P>
<P>[Chandler presses a button on the phone and puts the phone up to his ear to 
listen. Monica puts her ear by it too.]</P>
<P>Chandler: Hey, Joe!</P>
<P>[Joey’s apartment. Scenes change when the different people speak]</P>
<P>Joey: Dude, come home!</P>
<P>Chandler: What? Why?</P>
<P>Joey: Come home!</P>
<P>Chandler: Look, I can’t. What’s going on?</P>
<P>Joey: I don’t know how to tell you this, but I think that Monica’s cheating 
on ya! I told you that you shouldn’t have married someone much hotter than you! 
[Chandler looks at Monica. They nod then put their ears back to the phone. Joey 
walks out of his apartment and up to Monica’s door] Right, look. If you can’t 
come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna…</P>
<P>Chandler: [Loudly] No!</P>
<P>Joey: I just heard him!</P>
<P>Chandler: [Quiet] Can you hear him now?</P>
<P>Joey: No. Right, I’m going in!</P>
<P>Chandler: [Loudly] No! Wait!</P>
<P>Joey: I heard him again!</P>
<P>[Chandler starts to freak out on the spot]</P>
<P>Chandler: Right. Just stay there. I'm coming home.</P>
<P>Joey: Great. I’ll see you when you get here. I’m gonna wait out in the hall 
in case the dude comes out.</P>
<P>Chandler: Is that really necessary?</P>
<P>Joey: Absolutely. You’d do it for me! Not that you’d ever have to, ‘cos I 
know how to keep my women completely satisfied.</P>
<P>[Scene: Ross and Rachel’s apartment. Both Ross and Mike are sat on the sofa, 
with Fosters in their hands. Mike is blowing across the top of his bottle]</P>
<P>Ross: Shouldn’t the pizza be here by now? They said 30 minutes or less. How 
long has it been?</P>
<P>Mike: [Looks at watch] Eleven minutes. [Still looking at watch] And now 
twelve. [Picks up bottle] Do you like the beer?</P>
<P>Ross: I do. I do. Although it is actually a lager.</P>
<P>Mike: Oh. What’s the difference between a beer and a lager?</P>
<P>Ross: I don’t know. We can look it up.</P>
<P>Mike: Things are about to get wild!</P>
<P>[Scene: A bar. Phoebe and Rachel are carrying drinks]</P>
<P>Phoebe: Oh, god. Do you remember the girls’ nights that we used to have? 
Sitting around, talking about you and Ross?</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh, god. It seems like forever ago.</P>
<P>Phoebe: I know.</P>
<P><BR>[Both sit down]</P>
<P>Phoebe: So what’s going on with you and Ross?</P>
<P>Rachel: Well, um, I don’t know. I mean, for a long time, nothing. You know, 
actually, right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a little thing.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Woah! Oh my god! I love things! What happened?</P>
<P>Rachel: Well, um, first he told me that he liked how I looked, and then, erm, 
we had a little, erm, eye contact.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Eye contact?</P>
<P>Rachel: Uh huh.</P>
<P>Phoebe: I hope you were using protection.</P>
<P>[A waiter comes over with two drinks on his tray. He places them on the 
table]</P>
<P>Waiter: Excuse me, um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the 
bar.</P>
<P>[The waiter leaves. Phoebe and Rachel look to see who it is]</P>
<P>Phoebe: Should we send them something back? Yes, let’s do! Let’s send them 
mashed potatoes!!</P>
<P>Rachel: No, wait, don’t do that! It’s gonna make them think that they can 
come over here!</P>
<P>Phoebe: So, what if they do?</P>
<P>Rachel: We’re not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend. I have a…baby and 
a Ross.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Yeah, but, um, nothing has to happen. Just having fun. You know, not 
everything has to go as far as ‘eye contact’.</P>
<P>[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s apartment]</P>
<P>Monica: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you are not in Tulsa.</P>
<P>Chandler: Don’t you think it’s better for him to think that you’re cheating 
on me than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? [Silence] I heard it!</P>
<P>Monica: I don’t want him to think that I'm having an affair.</P>
<P><BR>Chandler: Alright. I’ve got a plan. I’ll go down the fire escape…</P>
<P>Monica: Yes. Because all good plans start with “I’ll just go down the fire 
escape…”</P>
<P>Chandler: Hear me out, woman! I’ll go down the fire escape, then I’ll wait 
for a while. Then, when I come back up the stairs, it’ll just be like I got back 
from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in here and see that there is no guy in 
here.</P>
<P>Monica: Aren’t you afraid that Joey’s going to figure all this out? [Silence] 
I heard it!</P>
<P>[Chandler goes to the window, opens it, looks out, then comes back in]</P>
<P>Chandler: Just gonna wait for a little while.</P>
<P><BR>Monica: Scary pigeon’s back?</P>
<P>Chandler: It’s huge!</P>
<P>[Scene: Ross and Rachel’s apartment. There is a nearly-empty pizza box on the 
table. Mike and Ross have swapped positions on the couch. Mike still has a 
bottle of Foster’s in his hand. He is making funny noises. Ross looks bored. 
Mike stops making the noise, looks at Ross, looks back at the bottle and 
continues to make the noise. Ross looks exasperated]</P>
<P>[Scene: Bar. Phoebe and Rachel are talking to the two men that sent the 
drinks over to them]</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh my god! I can’t believe you live in that building! My grandmother 
lives in that building, Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kinda smells of 
chicken? Looks like a potato?!?</P>
<P><BR>Bill: Spuds is your grandmother?</P>
<P>Rachel: Yeah! That’s my muppy!</P>
<P>Kevin: So, we’re on our way to a couple of parties. Maybe we can get your 
numbers and give you a call when we find something fun.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Yeah, I’m sorry. We weren’t really looking for anything to happen 
with you guys. I-I have a boyfriend.</P>
<P>Kevin: Alright. That’s no big deal.</P>
<P>[Kevin and Bill get up]</P>
<P>Bill: So, she has a boyfriend. [To Rachel] What is your situation?</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh, it’s complicated. I don’t actually have a boyfriend, but, 
erm…</P>
<P>Bill: Can I have your number?</P>
<P>Rachel: I’m sorry, no.</P>
<P>Bill: Okay [They start to leave]</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh, sure!</P>
<P>[Reaches into her handbag]</P>
<P>Phoebe: Oh my god! You’re giving your real number!</P>
<P>Bill: Okay, thanks. I’ll give you a call later tonight.</P>
<P>Rachel: Great. [Gives thumbs up]</P>
<P>Bill: Bye [Leaves]</P>
<P>Rachel, Phoebe: Bye</P>
<P>Phoebe: Wow. So that's great. You, Bill, Ross and Emma are going to be so 
happy together. What were you thinking?</P>
<P>Rachel: I don’t know. He was cute and he liked me. It was an impulse.</P>
<P>Phoebe: But what about Ross? What about your moment? Don’t you want to talk 
to Ross about it?</P>
<P>Rachel: No, no, ‘cos I know exactly how the conversation is going to go. “Hey 
Ross”, “You know, I think that we had a moment before” [As Ross] “Yeah, um, me 
too” [As herself] “Well, but I’m not sure I really wanna do anything about it!” 
[As Ross] “Yeah, um, me, um, neither.” [As herself] “Ross, should we just 
continue to live together and not really tell each other how we’re really 
feeling?” [As Ross] “Yeah, that works for me, um, um.”</P>
<P>Phoebe: Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation. But your 
Rachel was not whiney enough.</P>
<P>Rachel: Hey!</P>
<P>Phoebe: Better!</P>
<P>[Phoebe reaches for her drink]</P>
<P>Rachel: The point is: maybe I should stop waiting around, waiting for moments 
with Ross. I should just move on with my life.</P>
<P>Phoebe: So, really? Are you moving on from Ross?</P>
<P>Rachel: Dunno, do I have to decide right now?</P>
<P>Phoebe: You kinda just did. That guy’s gonna call you tonight. Ross is going 
to pick up the phone. That’s a pretty clear message.</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh my god! Ross!! Ross is gonna pick up the phone! Ah, I have to get 
my number back! Oh my god! He’s gone!</P>
<P>Phoebe: [As Rachel] “Ah, I have to get my number back!”, “Oh my god! He’s 
gone!” Dead on!</P>
<P>[Scene: Ross and Rachel’s apartment. Ross and Mile look bored out of their 
heads]</P>
<P>Mike: Passst. I’m gonna take off.</P>
<P>Ross: So soon?</P>
<P>Mike: Yeah.</P>
<P>Ross: Okay. Thanks, er, for the beer.</P>
<P>Mike: You mean lager.</P>
<P>Ross: Ah, yeah, good times.</P>
<P>[Ross opens door. Mike steps out through door. Ross closes door]</P>
<P>Mike: Ohh. [Relieved to be out of there]</P>
<P>Ross: Ohh. [Relieved that Mike has gone]</P>
<P>[Mike’s mobile phone rings]</P>
<P>Mike: Hello?</P>
<P>[Bar. Phoebe is on the other end of the phone. Scenes switch with the 
conversation]</P>
<P>Phoebe: Hey Mike, it’s me. Listen: Is Ross near you?</P>
<P>Mike: Uh no, I just left.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Well, you have to go back in.</P>
<P>Mike: What? Go back? To the land where time stands still?</P>
<P>Phoebe: I’m so sorry, honey, but, okay. Rachel gave this guy her number, and, 
erm, she does not want Ross to answer the phone, so you have to intercept all of 
his calls.</P>
<P>Mike: I can’t do that.</P>
<P>Phoebe: [To Rachel] He says that he can’t do that</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh, give me. [Rachel takes the phone of Phoebe] Hi, Mike! Hi, listen, 
I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what. If you do this, ah, Phoebe will 
do anything you want. Seriously, I’m talking dirty stuff.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Alright, give it here. [Phoebe takes the phone] Hello? I'm sorry 
about her, but, she wasn’t wrong about the dirty stuff.</P>
<P>Mike: Alright, I’ll do it. [Phoebe sticks her thumb up to Rachel] Really, 
though, how much dirtier can it get?</P>
<P>Phoebe: Oh, oh, Mike! Bye. [Hangs up]</P>
<P>[Scene: Ross and Rachel’s apartment. Knock at the door. Ross opens the door. 
Mike is there.]</P>
<P>Mike: Hey, buddy!</P>
<P>Ross: Hi!</P>
<P>Mike: Can I come back in?</P>
<P>Ross: W-Why? [Blocking route of entry]</P>
<P>Mike: Well, [negotiating an entrance] I was just thinking of how muck more we 
have to talk about.</P>
<P>Ross: [Exasperated] But, you left!</P>
<P>[Scene: Hallway between Monica/Chandler’s apartment and Joey’s apartment. 
Joey is sat on a stool, holding a baseball bat. Chandler runs up the stairs]</P>
<P>Joey: Wow, that didn’t take long. I thought you said Tulsa was a three-hour 
flight?</P>
<P>Chandler: Well,… you’re forgetting about the time difference.</P>
<P>[Joey looks puzzled for a second, then smiles and points at Chandler. 
Chandler smiles and points back. Chandler opens the door to his apartment and 
enters. Joey follows.]</P>
<P>Monica: Huh, Chandler – you’re home!</P>
<P>Chandler: That’s right. Your husband’s home, so now the sex can stop.</P>
<P>[Monica looks stunned]</P>
<P>Monica: What are you saying?</P>
<P>Chandler: Joey said that you’re in here with another man!</P>
<P>Monica: There's no man in here! How dare you accuse me of that? [Slaps 
Chandler]</P>
<P>Joey: Alright, alright. Then maybe you won’t mind if me and my friend takes a 
look around then. Huh! Where you at?</P>
<P>[Joey goes into Monica and Chandler’s bedroom. Banging can be heard]</P>
<P>Chandler: What’s he doing?</P>
<P>Monica: I arranged some pillows on the bed to make it look like a guy!</P>
<P>[Both laugh. Joey enters]</P>
<P>Joey: Bedroom’s clear, although you might need some new pillows.</P>
<P>Chandler: Alright, well, I’ll check the guest bedroom.</P>
<P>[Chandler heads off to guest bedroom. Joey walks up to Monica and starts 
sniffing loudly and heavily]</P>
<P>Joey: Why do I smell men’s cologne?</P>
<P><BR>[Monica smells Joey]</P>
<P>Monica: I think that's you.</P>
<P>[Joey smells himself]</P>
<P>Joey: Oh yeah, I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.</P>
<P>[Chandler re-enters]</P>
<P>Chandler: Nobody here, Joe.</P>
<P>Joey: I guess not.</P>
<P>Monica: I can’t believe you thought I was cheating. You owe me an 
apology.</P>
<P>Joey: You’re right, Monica. I’m so sorry.</P>
<P>Monica: It’s an honest mistake. It can happen to anybody. Alright, see 
ya.</P>
<P>[Monica pushes Joey towards the door. Joey sees Chandler’s cases]</P>
<P>Joey: Wait, wait, wait a minute. If you’ve just got back from Tulsa, how did 
your suitcase beat you here?</P>
<P>[Chandler looks at Monica]</P>
<P>Chandler: I climb down the fire escape, and you can’t put that in the 
closet?</P>
<P><BR>[Joey looks shocked]</P>
<P>[Scene: Ross and Rachel’s apartment. Ross and Mike are sat on the sofa. Mike 
is reading out of a book]</P>
<P>Mike: So, with the exception of the fermentation process, beer and ale are 
basically the same thing. Fascinating, isn’t it?</P>
<P>Ross: [Looking bored] Maybe you should look up fascinating.</P>
<P>[Phone rings]</P>
<P>Mike: I’ll get it [Jumps across Ross and grabs the phone. Ross looks shocked] 
Hello? Ross’ place, Mike speaking. [Passing phone to Ross] It’s for you.</P>
<P>[Ross takes phone]</P>
<P>Ross: I don’t understand what just happened here.</P>
<P>[Scene: Monica and Chandler’s apartment. As before]</P>
<P>Joey: What’s going on?</P>
<P>Chandler: I’m sorry. I told you that I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend 
the night with Monica and I didn’t…didn’t know…didn’t think you’d 
understand.</P>
<P>Joey: What? You think I’m too dumb to know that a husband needs to be with 
his wife? Uh? You think I’m like, duhhh! [Taps head with baseball bat – it hurts 
him]</P>
<P>Monica: Joey?</P>
<P>Joey: Yeah?</P>
<P>Monica: I don’t know what to say. We shouldn’t have lied to you.</P>
<P>Chandler: I feel so bad. Is there, is there anything I can do to make it up 
to you?</P>
<P>Joey: You could go to the game with me, even though I know you said you 
couldn’t, but then you lied to me, tricked me and gave me a bump on the 
head.</P>
<P>Chandler: I’m sorry. That’s the one thing I can’t do. I promised that I’d be 
with Monica.</P>
<P>Joey: [Looking sad] Alright.</P>
<P>Monica: You can go.</P>
<P>Chandler: [Turning around] What?</P>
<P>Monica: You should go to the game. It’s okay, I want you to.</P>
<P>Chandler: Really? Are you going to be okay?</P>
<P>Monica: Yeah, it’ll be fine. Y’know, maybe I’ll stay and practice the art of 
seduction.</P>
<P>Chandler: You’re gonna put sweats on and clean, aren’t ya?</P>
<P>Monica: That’s gonna be so hot!</P>
