<BODY>THE ONE WITH PHOEBE'S BIRTHDAY DINNER 
<P><BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P><BR>Written by: Scott Silveri<BR>Directed by: David Schwimmer<BR>Transcribed 
by: Christoph Päper</P>
<P><BR>[Scene: Central Perk. All except Chandler, plus Emma.]</P>
<P>Phoebe: Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night<BR>of my 
birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.</P>
<P>Joey: Thursday? But that's Halloween.</P>
<P>Phoebe: So?</P>
<P>Joey: [It's just] So spooky, that's all.</P>
<P>Ross: So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?</P>
<P>Phoebe: No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to<BR>work. 
Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to<BR>show my true 
colors.</P>
<P>Rachel: Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of<BR>us has 
to stay home and watch Emma. (to Ross:) Which one of us should<BR>go to 
dinner?</P>
<P>Phoebe: Oh, Rachel!</P>
<P>Ross: Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Oh, yay!</P>
<P>Ross: Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you<BR>know 
what? We all haven't been together the six of us in such a long<BR>time.</P>
<P>Monica: What are you talking about? We're all together right now.</P>
<P>Rachel: Um, Mon, Chandler's not here.</P>
<P>Monica: Oh, dear god!</P>
<P><BR>*Opening Credits*</P>
<P><BR>[Scene: Tulsa, a conference room. Chandler is chairing a group 
of<BR>eight people.]</P>
<P>Chandler: Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together<BR>for 
the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any<BR>questions? 
(colleague raises hand) Yes, Ken is it?</P>
<P>Ken: That's right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa<BR>is 
that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without<BR>realizing what you 
were saying yes to?</P>
<P>Chandler: (laughs) Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken.<BR>(both 
turning away to files) But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's<BR>get started, by 
take a look at last quarter's figures. (The female<BR>next to Chandler starts 
smoking, towards heRoss:) Ah, Claudia, aren't<BR>you supposed to blow smoke up 
the bosses' ass?</P>
<P>Claudia: I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?</P>
<P>Chandler: No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right<BR>now, I 
can't remember why. (to everyone:) You're not allowed to smoke<BR>in this 
office. Not right?</P>
<P>Claudia: Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with 
fifteen<BR>people or less. (passing the pack) Would you like one?</P>
<P>Chandler: Alright, lo...look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest<BR>of 
you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. (everyone lits) So you<BR>all smoke 
then? That's almost rude, that I'm not.</P>
<P>Ken: That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke ...</P>
<P>Chandler: (loud) Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke,<BR>my 
wife would kill me.</P>
<P>Ken: I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York?</P>
<P>Chandler: I always liked you, Ken. (takes a cig)</P>
<P><BR>[Scene: The Bings'. Monica in bathrobe, merely covered. 
Someone'S<BR>knocking at the door.]</P>
<P>Phoebe: (from outside) Trick or treat! (It's obviously Halloween eve,<BR>the 
night of her birthday dinner.)</P>
<P>Monica: (opening the door) Hey!</P>
<P>Phoebe: Ooh, and treat it is. (Monica's breasts.)</P>
<P>Monica: Hmhmm. (ties up)</P>
<P>Phoebe: Wow, so glad I changed. Almost weared my ??? outfit that<BR>can't 
contain my breasts.</P>
<P>Monica: This is not, what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating and Chandler's<BR>gonna 
be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Ohh. Oh wait! (Jis) you guys won't be late for my dinner,<BR>will 
you?</P>
<P>Monica: Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over 
a<BR>week. We'll probably be the first ones there.</P>
<P>Phoebe: 'kay, see you there. Happy humping! (outside meeting<BR>Chandler.) 
Hey...hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god,<BR>don't people know, 
you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?</P>
<P>Chandler: Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas<BR>and 
offices with fewer than fifteen people.</P>
<P>Phoebe: You smoked!</P>
<P>Chandler: No! I just happened t'do a lot trivias about smoking 
in<BR>different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are 
called<BR>Leyhallalookoos.</P>
<P>Phoebe: (smells at him) Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.</P>
<P>Chandler: Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?</P>
<P>Phoebe: Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound ...<BR>and 
the breasts of a great goddess.</P>
<P>Chandler: Pheebs?</P>
<P>Phoebe: (embarrassed) I'm gonna go. (leaves to stairs)</P>
<P>Chandler: (getting in) Okay, something to cover the smell ... 
Oven<BR>cleaner! (sprays himself, reads label) Unscented!</P>
<P>Monica: (naughty in doorway) Welcome home. I've missed you. join me<BR>in the 
bedroom?</P>
<P>Chandler: No thanks, I'm good.</P>
<P>Monica: (comes over) O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?</P>
<P>Chandler: (shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just get<BR>off the 
plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a<BR>shower.</P>
<P>Monica: You don't need a shower.</P>
<P>Chandler: (still backs away) Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself<BR>during 
some turbulences.</P>
<P>Monica: What do I smell? (sniffs him) I smell smoke. Huh--did 
you<BR>smoke?</P>
<P>Chandler: Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay,<BR>five. A 
pack. Two pack...a...a carton. Three big fat cartons in two<BR>days. (How many 
cigs are there in one pack and how many packs in one<BR>carton in the US?) But 
it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonna<BR>smoke anymore.</P>
<P>Monica: (gets a pack out of his jacket)</P>
<P>Chandler: But, those are for you.</P>
<P><BR>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's. Ross phones, Rachel and Emma are there.]</P>
<P>Ross: Alright, we'll just, uh, see when you get here. Bye. (hangs up)<BR>Huh, 
that was my mom, she's stuck in terrible traffic.</P>
<P>Rachel: Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not 
leave<BR>Emma.</P>
<P>Ross: Oh, what were the other two?</P>
<P>Rachel: Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you<BR>know, 
I'm not going.</P>
<P>Ross: I know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and ...<BR>hey, I 
know how hard it is for you, but ... but Emma is gonna be<BR>fine. My mom is 
gonna be with her. She's great with kids.</P>
<P>Rachel: She is?</P>
<P>Ross: Ya.</P>
<P>Rachel: What about (?) Monica.</P>
<P>Ross: Hey, you only heard Monica's side of that. That little fatso<BR>was a 
terror.</P>
<P>Rachel: Ish. I just don't think I can bear it.</P>
<P>Ross: Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.</P>
<P>Rachel: Uch.</P>
<P>Ross: Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you,<BR>why 
don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom<BR>and then I'll 
meet you there.</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh-A.</P>
<P>Ross: No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, 
the<BR>world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. 
(Slang<BR>right?)</P>
<P>Rachel: You need to learn some new slang.</P>
<P>Ross: I'm serious. C'mon, you should go. Here. (shoves her outside,<BR>while 
she tries to stay) No, uh-uh, just go.</P>
<P>Rachel: What ... Oh! (points inside)</P>
<P>Ross: No! No, you know what? (closes the door) You [can't get in<BR>there] 
(?), the baby's fine, now squam (?). Yeah, [I told you a|Tell<BR>your] story 
walking. (?)</P>
<P>Rachel: I was just going to say that I left my keys.</P>
<P>Ross: Oh, (door is locked) holy moly are we in a pickle now.</P>
<P><BR>[Scene: The restaurant. Phoebe and Joey are sitting alone at a 
table<BR>for six.]</P>
<P>Phoebe: Where is everyone? They're forty minutes late.</P>
<P>Joey: I know, u-uch.</P>
<P>Phoebe: I'm starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate<BR>nothing 
all day.</P>
<P>Joey: What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.</P>
<P>Waiter: (with British accent) Soo, are we expecting the rest of our<BR>party 
shortly?</P>
<P>Phoebe: Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their<BR>arrival is 
in the offing.</P>
<P>Waiter: Right. We do have a table for two available, perhaps you<BR>would be 
more comfortable.</P>
<P>Joey: No, they're comin', we're waitin' right here.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Joseph! (to waiter) Thou needn't worry, they shan't be long.</P>
<P>Waiter: It's just that we do have some large parties waiting.</P>
<P>Phoebe: One really does have a stick up one's ass. Doesn't one?</P>
<P><BR>[Scene: The Bings'.]</P>
<P>Monica: How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad<BR>with 
a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling.</P>
<P>Chandler: I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.</P>
<P>Monica: So what? Don't you have any will power?</P>
<P>Chandler: Will power? I've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs<BR>(?) 
without taking the tin foil off.</P>
<P>Monica: You said that was sexy!</P>
<P>Chandler: 'kay, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna 
smoke<BR>again.</P>
<P>Monica: That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again.</P>
<P>Chandler: You forbid me?</P>
<P>Monica: Mhmm.</P>
<P>Chandler: You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she<BR>here by 
the way?</P>
<P>Monica: Don't joke (?) with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now.</P>
<P>Chandler: Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?</P>
<P>Monica: Yes.</P>
<P>Chandler: Then, I might as well ... (graps the cigs) do this (lights<BR>one, 
exhales). Not really sure what to do now.</P>
<P>Monica: Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna do: We are already late<BR>for 
Phoebe's birthday dinner, so you point out put out that<BR>cigarette, we're 
gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.</P>
<P>Chandler: Fine. What!?</P>
<P>Monica: Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating, and when we don't do<BR>it 
now, we'll have to wait till next month. (walks towards bedroom)</P>
<P>Chandler: You serious? (follows)</P>
<P>Monica: Oh yeah!</P>
<P>Chandler: Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking.</P>
<P>Monica: Huh, and no cuddling.</P>
<P>Chandler: And no kissing your neck.</P>
<P>Monica: Oh good, I hate it when you do that</P>
<P>Chandler: And lots of kissing your neck.</P>
<P><BR>[Scene: Outside Ross and Rachel's.]</P>
<P>Ross: Okay, well the ??? is not home.</P>
<P>Rachel: No. Uch.</P>
<P>Ross: Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has<BR>the 
keys.</P>
<P>Rachel: Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to 
do<BR>something--knock that door down!</P>
<P>Ross: I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y...you 
know,<BR>everything is gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.</P>
<P>Rachel: What if she jumped out the basinet?</P>
<P>Ross: Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh my god, I left the water running.</P>
<P>Ross: Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull<BR>yourself 
together, okay?</P>
<P>Rachel: Ah, did I leave the stove on?</P>
<P>Ross: You never cooked since 1996. (Actually Rachel cooked in "609 -<BR>TOW 
Ross Got High", first aired 1999-11-25.)</P>
<P>Rachel: Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird<BR>could 
fly in there.</P>
<P>Ross: Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think<BR>.. 
listen, listen!</P>
<P>Rachel: Ubb.</P>
<P>Ross: A pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared Rachel turns away) No,<BR>no 
wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught<BR>fire. The baby, 
seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty<BR>bird's aid. The eagle, 
however, misconstrues as an act of aggression<BR>and grabs the baby on its 
talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the<BR>apartment with water. Baby and bird 
still up lays (?) are locked in a<BR>death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, 
that fills the apartment.</P>
<P>Rachel: Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true.</P>
<P><BR>[Scene: The restaurant with still just Phoebe and Joey.]</P>
<P>Waiter: Hello.</P>
<P>Phoebe &amp; Joey: Hey.</P>
<P>Waiter: It's been an hour. ??? be willing to reconsider switching to<BR>a 
smaller table.</P>
<P>Joey: Maybe we should just eat now.</P>
<P>Waiter: You can't order until your entire party has arrived.<BR>Restaurant 
policy.</P>
<P>Joey: Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there's<BR>still 
some food left on their place, okay, what's the restaurant's<BR>policy about 
people eatin' that?</P>
<P>Waiter: Estrangement (?).</P>
<P>Joey: But it happens? (waiter leaves) I'm gotta go to the bathroom.</P>
<P>Phoebe: No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my<BR>own. If 
they ask me to move, I cave.</P>
<P>Joey: If you ask me to stay, I'll pee. (leaves)</P>
<P>Maitre D': Good evening, Miss. (Phoebe turns her head away) Miss?<BR>(from 
the opposite side) Miss? (ahe turns again) Miss!</P>
<P>Phoebe: Okay, fine, I'll move. Alright, you don't have to manhandle<BR>me. 
(gets up) Where? (he points at a smaller table) Okay. Thank you.<BR>Wach.</P>
<P>Joey: (returns to their old table where elderly people are sitting<BR>now, 
sits) Finally you guys made it. (looks up, turns left to<BR>Phoebe's chair) 
Pheebs, who the hell--uhuhh!</P>
<P><BR>[Scene: The Bings' bedroom, Chandler is undressing, Monica in 
bed<BR>already.]</P>
<P>Monica: Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.</P>
<P>Chandler: Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while 
we're<BR>fighting this way.</P>
<P>Monica: Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted<BR>to 
have sex right after my uncle's funeral</P>
<P>Chandler: That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not<BR>gonna do 
this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be<BR>conceived?</P>
<P>Monica: No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch.<BR>For 
what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on<BR>you so hard 
about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the<BR>end of the world.</P>
<P>Chandler: Mean it?</P>
<P>Monica: Yah.</P>
<P>Chandler: You are incredible. Unless, I...I'm not gonna smoke again.<BR>And 
if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. (they<BR>kiss)</P>
<P>Monica: D'you want to?</P>
<P>Chandler: Yeah, let's celebrate life!</P>
<P>Monica: 'kay.</P>
<P><BR>[Scene: Ms. Geller, Rachel and Ross storm into the apartment.]</P>
<P>Rachel: Och, god. (seeing Emma) Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so<BR>sorry 
we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever<BR>again. Uch.</P>
<P>Ross: Great. So let's get going?</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving<BR>her 
again.</P>
<P>Ms. Geller: I understand, seperation is hard. One time I was about 
to<BR>leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took<BR>off 
all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out:<BR>"Mommy, I'm a 
girl, take me with you."</P>
<P>Ross: Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.</P>
<P><BR>[Scene: Bings in bed, finished.]</P>
<P>Chandler: Uhh. You are welcome.</P>
<P>Monica: You know what? Let's not talk.</P>
<P>Chandler: What?</P>
<P>Monica: Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.</P>
<P>Chandler: But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple 
of<BR>cigarettes--no big deal.</P>
<P>Monica: Oh, blablablabaybaybay.</P>
<P>Chandler: Leave it.</P>
<P>Monica: I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said<BR>you 
wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.</P>
<P>Chandler: You tricked me to get me into bed?</P>
<P>Monica: That's right, I got mine.</P>
<P>Chandler: I feel so used.</P>
<P><BR>[Scene: Restaurant, still just the not-couple.]</P>
<P>Phoebe: Well, I guess they're not coming. You wanna just order?</P>
<P>Joey: Thank you. (stands up and kisses her lips.) Waiter! 'lright,<BR>this is 
gonna be fast, so try to keep uPhoebe: Risotto with the<BR>shaped truffels and 
the roasted rip steak with the golden<BR>Chanderelles and a Bordelaise sauce and 
that any that stuff I just<BR>said means snails. (Hope, *I* kept up.)</P>
<P>Waiter: Er--does not.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?</P>
<P>Waiter: Oh, they're both exclus...</P>
<P>Phoebe: Both it is, thank you.</P>
<P>Joey: Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you 
bring<BR>everything as soon as it's ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don't 
care.</P>
<P>Ross &amp; Rachel: (entering) Hey, hi, hi!</P>
<P>Waiter: I'll just wait to put your order in.</P>
<P>Phoebe: You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?</P>
<P>Ross: I'm so sorry ...</P>
<P>Rachel: We got locked out of the apartment, we ...</P>
<P>Joey: That's a great story--can I eat it?</P>
<P>Ross: And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.</P>
<P>Rachel: N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got<BR>to 
do.</P>
<P>Phoebe: And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted,<BR>worrying 
about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely<BR>here with you 
and, oh, she spit up!</P>
<P>Ross: What?</P>
<P>Rachel: She spit up. Judy! She spi...Judy! Look alive, Judy! (they<BR>sit 
down) Thank you.</P>
<P>Ross: Thanks. Oh.</P>
<P>Rachel: Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave?<BR>What 
should I have?</P>
<P>Joey: (mumbling) Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.</P>
<P>Ross: Y'know this ??? is incredible.</P>
<P>Joey: Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.</P>
<P>Ross: Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.</P>
<P>Rachel: Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.</P>
<P>Joey: And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, 
because<BR>..</P>
<P>Monica: (entering with husband) Happy birthday!</P>
<P>Joey: Son of a bitch!</P>
<P>Phoebe: Wher-where have you been?</P>
<P>Monica: Well, we had a little fight.</P>
<P>Chandler: I would never lie to get someone into bed.</P>
<P>Monica: You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. (being sat down)<BR>Ooh, 
uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How d'you get a bigger<BR>table? 
You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut<BR>up Monica. 
Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.</P>
<P>Chandler: I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.</P>
<P>Waiter: I'll give you another minute.</P>
<P>Joey: Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after<BR>the 
waiter)</P>
<P>Ross: Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive<BR>mother. 
Okay, you need to stop.</P>
<P>Rachel: Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to 
the<BR>beauty salon?</P>
<P>Chandler: You mean the lully story?</P>
<P>Ross: (childish) Huh-huh, they already know it.</P>
<P>Phoebe: You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe<BR>you 
should order.</P>
<P>Joey: (returned) No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what<BR>they 
want.</P>
<P>Monica: Why would you do that?</P>
<P>Joey: Chandler, control your woman!</P>
<P>Rachel: (lifts for a toast) Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would<BR>like 
to start the celebration and make a toast ... to Phoebe. She<BR>dropped her 
sock.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Aw ... what?</P>
<P>Rachel: N-no, Emma dropped her sock.</P>
<P>Monica: Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told<BR>me she 
was out of town.</P>
<P>Rachel: Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on<BR>the 
ground.</P>
<P>Phoebe: 's a good toast.</P>
<P>Rachel: (to Ross) Could you please get her attention?</P>
<P>Ross: W-oa ... Mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)</P>
<P>Phoebe: (getting up) Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick<BR>up 
the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody scared) I'm sorry, was that<BR>rude? 
Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?)<BR>that is this 
evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but<BR>all I wanted to do 
was have dinner with my friends on my birthday.<BR>And you are all so late and 
you didn't even have the courtesy to<BR>call. (her cellular rings) Well, it's 
too late now.</P>
<P>Ross: Well, ??? think that's us?</P>
<P>Phoebe: well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) Hello?</P>
<P>Joey: (to Chandler and Monica) Well, what is going on with you two?</P>
<P>Monica: Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.</P>
<P>Chandler: Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not<BR>ovulating at 
all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.</P>
<P>Monica: Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.</P>
<P>Chandler: (to Joey) You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked<BR>me 
into having sex with her.</P>
<P>Joey: So? Did have sex, right?</P>
<P>Chandler: What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?</P>
<P>Phoebe: (returns) Okay, that was Mike.</P>
<P>Rachel: Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here<BR>one 
hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your<BR>birthday 
celebration.</P>
<P>Phoebe: Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, I'm gonna<BR>take 
off.</P>
<P>Rachel: What?</P>
<P>Phoebe: Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait.<BR>Wait, 
I'm not t--not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends<BR>to be with her 
boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! (waves to<BR>the bar) Judy! Bye.</P>
